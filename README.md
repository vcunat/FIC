## Fractal Image Compressor

A fractal image compressor, done to satisfy a my project and bachelor's thesis. Quite dead since the defense in August 2009, but contributors are welcome. Sources aren't annotated yet, but the license is GPL2+.

User features:
- loads and saves *.png, *.bmp, *.jpg
- encodes and decodes *.fic (its own format)
- modules have many settings
- measures error, compression ratio, zooms, image comparison
- undocumented batch interface
- basic multithreading support
- GUI translated to English and Czech

Dev features:
- C++, Qt gui
- very modular, individual parts of algorithms are easily replaceable and configurable
- coded for high performance, uses templates extensively
- completely in English, except for the thesis (which is in Czech)

TODO:
- more description
- fixing 64-bit compilation issues
